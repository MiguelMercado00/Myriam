# Myriam
Myriam is a personal assistant in the pure Jarvis style, it has many of its features, automation to use it on a day-to-day basis, I hope you enjoy it. Blessings.

Myriam is a virtual assistant that is very easy to use and very easy to understand, currently Miriam's code is in Spanish along with its functionalities, but if you want you can change it to English or any other language you want, because gTTS supports multiple languages like: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Russian and many more. To give an instruction to Miriam is simply to run the code and tell the instruction something like this: "Myriam, ¿que día es hoy?", "Myriam, ¿cual es la temperatura?", "Myriam, ¿que día es hoy?", "Myriam, reproduce 'Toosie Slide' de Drake", "Myriam, dame las noticias de hoy", etc. Among many other very useful functionalities for day to day, if you have any questions you can contact me through discord as MiguelMercado#8172, I hope you enjoy it and it is to your liking, blessings.
